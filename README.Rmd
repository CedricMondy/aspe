# aspe

{aspe} fournit des outils autorisant simplement la plupart des traitements de base à partir d'une sauvegarde (dump SQL) de la base de données ASPE de l'OFB. Ces traitements comprennent les calculs d'abondances, densités, distribution en tailles et la détection de tendances à l'échelle de la station. Ces calculs sont accompagnés de fonctionnalités graphiques.

The goal of {aspe} is to is to provide a suite of tools for most of the common processing of the ASPE database including importation from a SQL format dump, calculation of abundances, densities, size distributions, temporal trends for populations at the station level, along with graphical output.



## Installation

You can install the released version of aspe from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("aspe")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(aspe)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
